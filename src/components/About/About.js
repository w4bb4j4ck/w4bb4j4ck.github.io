                    <p>I've had a very strong interest in building things and solving problems with logic for as long as 
                        I can remember. My focus and passion as a Software Developer has grown exponentially over the years, 
                        now I'm looking forward to applying my years of broad knowledge and expertise to help drive and support 
                        a companyâ€™s vision and add value wherever I am able.</p>
